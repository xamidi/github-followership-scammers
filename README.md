## Followership Scammers on GitHub ([repository](https://github.com/xamidi/github-followership-scammers))

I like to follow people back when they have decent looking profiles.
But there are people on GitHub trying to look "important" by following many users, only to **unfollow** them **after being followed back**.  
So they often end up with hundreds of followers while only following a few accounts, and can use their profiles to further scam third parties, such as employers or maintainers.

In order to not let such selfish people profit from my kindness, I
- use [whosnotfollowing.github.io](https://whosnotfollowing.github.io/) ([repository](https://github.com/whosnotfollowing/whosnotfollowing.github.io)) to detect them,
- unfollow them and unstar all their repositories (if any), and
- expose them via the list below.

**I will *not* add people to this list whose actions I have not witnessed myself.**  
But I encourage you to create your own lists based on your experiences. Feel free to fork or partially copy this repository.

I will keep all entries, except for those who manage to go down to zero scammed followers and request removal in [discussions](https://github.com/xamidi/github-followership-scammers/discussions).
