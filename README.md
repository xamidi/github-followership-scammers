## Followership Scammers on GitHub

I like to follow people back when they have decent looking profiles.
But there are people on GitHub trying to look "important" by following many users, only to **unfollow** them **after being followed back**.  
So they often end up with hundreds of followers while only following a few accounts, and can use their profiles to further scam third parties, such as employers or maintainers.

In order to not let such selfish people profit from my kindness, I
- use [whosnotfollowing.github.io](https://whosnotfollowing.github.io/) ([repo](https://github.com/whosnotfollowing/whosnotfollowing.github.io)) to detect them,
- unfollow them and unstar all their repositories (if any), and
- expose them via the list below.

**I will *not* add people to this list, whose deeds I did not witness myself.**  
But I encourage you to create your own lists based on your experiences. Feel free to fork or partially copy this repository.
